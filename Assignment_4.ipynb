    "1. Single Inheritance- It enables child-class to inherit from parent class. e.g Father-->Child\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance- It enables child-class to inherit from multiple class. e.g Grandfather-->Father & Mother-->Child\n",
    "3. Multilevel Inheritance- When features from parent class is inherited by intermediary class & also possessed by class inheriting from intermediary class e.g Grandparent->Father->Child\n",
    "4. Hierarchichal Inheritance- When multiple child classes are derived from same parent class. e.g Father--> Child & Child\n",
    "5. Hybrid Inheritance- When class is derived from two differnt class but one parent class is not base class, it is derived from original base class."
